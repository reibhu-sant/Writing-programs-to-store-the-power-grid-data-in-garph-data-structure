Writing programs to store the power grid data in garph data structure
Course Data Structures and Algorithms

In this project, a power grid system where data of connected houses with different propagators are stored using python program with the help of graph data structures. The goal is to use graph data structure and perform certain operations such addition, removal of houses and propagators from the designed structure. Here we are using dictionary as an adjacency list to store the data in graph.

Skills and Tools

Graphs, operations on adjacecny list graph, house creation, propogation creation, house removal.
